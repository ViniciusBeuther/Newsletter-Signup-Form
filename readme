For this project I would like to implement a website to user register an email address and validate them.

Users should be able to:

- Add their email and submit the form
- See a success message with their email after successfully submitting the form
- See form validation messages if:
  - The field is left empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

The tecnologies that I'll use for this project are:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- SASS
- JAVASCRIPT

This project design I got from Front End mentor website.
